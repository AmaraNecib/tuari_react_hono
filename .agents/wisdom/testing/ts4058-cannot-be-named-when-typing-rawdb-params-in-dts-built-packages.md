## TS4058 "cannot be named" when typing `rawDb` params in dts-built packages (🟠 Major)

Typing `sqlite?: any` → `sqlite?: BetterSqliteDatabase` on an exported
function whose INFERRED return carries the type (e.g. `rawDatabase`
field) breaks the tsup `dts` build: the emitter resolves the alias
`Database.Database` to the UMD-global `BetterSqlite3.Database`, which it
cannot name in a module bundle. Annotated positions (params, explicit
return annotations that name a LOCAL exported alias) are fine. The
failure is specific to *inferred* return types that inline the external
type. The app's `index.ts` is a server entry (empty d.ts) yet the dts
step still type-checks exported functions in the entry graph.

Fix pattern: give the exported function an explicit return type named
via an exported local alias, but NOT `Awaited<ReturnType<typeof f>>`
(that is circular once you annotate `f` with it). Declare the shape
explicitly. Verified on #204: `createAppDependencies` got an explicit
17-field `AppDependencies` type.

**Always**: after typing a previously-`any` rawDb param, run
`pnpm --filter @tuari/api build` (or the package's tsup build) locally.
Typecheck alone does NOT catch TS4058.
