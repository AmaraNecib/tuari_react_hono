## Service-layer methods may be stubbed business rules (🟠 Major)

`WorkforceService.createRole` throws `CompanyError("BUSINESS_RULE", ...)`. The
custom-role-management feature is deliberately unimplemented. Tests that assume a
CRUD round-trip through the service will fail for the wrong reason. When proving
adapter wiring, prefer behavior that discriminates the adapters without touching
unimplemented rules: e.g. `listRoles()` returns `{ items: [] }` via the in-memory
store but throws `/no such table/` via sqlite against a schema-less `:memory:` db.

**Always**: check the service method for an early `throw` before writing a round-trip test.
