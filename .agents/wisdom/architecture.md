# Architecture Wisdom

## Barrel re-exports: "export the const" is incomplete without the index re-export (🟠 Major)

Issue #206 said "export `reportFilterInputSchema` from `reports-contract.ts`" — but that module was imported only by `app-contract.ts` and NEVER re-exported from the package index, so the exported const was still unreachable from `@tuari/contracts` (the only import path the API uses). The fix needed BOTH the `export const` AND `export * from "./reports-contract"` in the index (consistent with `invoice-contract`/`payment-contract`/`update-contract`/`rbac-contract`). The test failure (`reportFilterInputSchema` undefined) caught it immediately.

**Always**: when an issue says "export X from module Y", verify module Y is actually reachable from the package entry (`src/index.ts`) before implementing — grep the index for `export * from` covering Y.

## In-memory adapters duplicate ownership-history helpers across domains (🟡 Minor)

`InMemoryWorkforceRepository` and `InMemoryOperationsRepository` both carry
byte-identical private helpers (`insertProjectManagerOwnershipHistory`,
`endActiveProjectManagerOwnershipHistory`, `insertWarehouseManagerOwnershipHistory`,
`endActiveWarehouseManagerOwnershipHistory`, plus state-history variants) because
both operate on the shared `InMemoryStore`. When retyping them (any → typed
`Omit<Record, "id"|"endDate"|"createdAt"|"updatedAt">` + `AuditSnapshot`), both
copies must be edited in lockstep — a real maintenance hazard. Tracked as #202;
candidate home: `inmemory-store.ts` alongside `normalizeAudit`/`now`/`newId`.

**Always**: when a change touches these helpers, edit both files; prefer extracting
to the store module.

## Record types mirror external table shapes (🟡 Minor)

`AuthUserRecord` / `BootstrapStateRecord` in `company.types.ts` hand-mirror the
auth `user` and `app_bootstrap_state` schemas. The audit repository reads them
(`u.phoneNumber`, `s.singleton === 1`), but nothing writes them today. Divergence
risk if the schemas evolve; the type comments acknowledge this. Alternative:
derive from `typeof schema.user.$inferSelect` if schema coupling is acceptable.

## Ports & adapters: config flows through the composition root only (💡 Design Principle)

`createAppDependencies(sqlite, drizzleDb, auth, config = createAppConfig())` — the
optional trailing config param keeps every existing caller unchanged while letting
tests inject `DB_ADAPTER=inmemory`. The `createCompanyRepository(rawDb, config)`
factory switches adapters; other modules (inventory/invoice/payment) still use the
sqlite handle until their in-memory adapters exist. Keep the param appended, never
inserted mid-signature.
