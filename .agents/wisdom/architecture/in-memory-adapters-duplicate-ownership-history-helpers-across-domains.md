## In-memory adapters duplicate ownership-history helpers across domains (🟡 Minor)

`InMemoryWorkforceRepository` and `InMemoryOperationsRepository` both carry
byte-identical private helpers (`insertProjectManagerOwnershipHistory`,
`endActiveProjectManagerOwnershipHistory`, `insertWarehouseManagerOwnershipHistory`,
`endActiveWarehouseManagerOwnershipHistory`, plus state-history variants) because
both operate on the shared `InMemoryStore`. When retyping them (any → typed
`Omit<Record, "id"|"endDate"|"createdAt"|"updatedAt">` + `AuditSnapshot`), both
copies must be edited in lockstep, a real maintenance hazard. Tracked as #202;
candidate home: `inmemory-store.ts` alongside `normalizeAudit`/`now`/`newId`.

**Always**: when a change touches these helpers, edit both files; prefer extracting
to the store module.
