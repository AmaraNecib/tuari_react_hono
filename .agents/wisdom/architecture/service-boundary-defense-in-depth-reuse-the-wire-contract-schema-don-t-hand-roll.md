## Service-boundary defense-in-depth: reuse the wire contract schema, don't hand-roll (💡 Design Principle)

`AuthBootstrapService` (#226) relied entirely on the ORPC wire gate; nothing
validated at the service boundary, so a mis-wired port or future caller could
create a first user with a blank phone (never counted as "configured" by
`hasConfiguredUsers`, enabling a second bootstrap), hash an empty/short
password, or store an untrimmed/over-long name. Fix: run
`authBootstrapInputSchema.safeParse(input)` as the service's first statement and
return a `VALIDATION` failure result before hashing or touching the port. The
wire gate and the service gate reference the SAME schema object imported from
`@tuari/contracts`, so drift between the two enforcement points is impossible
by construction, the strongest form of "validate at the boundary". This
extends the `AccountService` precedent (reuses `algerianPhoneSchema.safeParse`)
into the pattern for service-boundary input checks: never duplicate the
validity definition in the service.

**Always**: when an issue says "harden input at the service boundary", reuse
the existing contract schema via `safeParse` rather than hand-rolling checks;
consume `parsed.data` (already normalized by schema `.trim()`s) downstream.
