## Record types mirror external table shapes (🟡 Minor)

`AuthUserRecord` / `BootstrapStateRecord` in `company.types.ts` hand-mirror the
auth `user` and `app_bootstrap_state` schemas. The audit repository reads them
(`u.phoneNumber`, `s.singleton === 1`), but nothing writes them today. Divergence
risk if the schemas evolve; the type comments acknowledge this. Alternative:
derive from `typeof schema.user.$inferSelect` if schema coupling is acceptable.
