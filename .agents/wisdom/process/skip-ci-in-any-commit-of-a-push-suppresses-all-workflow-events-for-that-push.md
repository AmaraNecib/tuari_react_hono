## `[skip ci]` in any commit of a push suppresses ALL workflow events for that push (🟠 Major)

Pushing the Greptile-fix commit together with an evidence commit whose message
contained `[skip ci]` produced NO new CI run. GitHub skips the push's
workflow triggers if any commit in the pushed range carries the marker. The
PR then had checks attached only to an old head (empty-commit head), while
CI/check-runs for the real head were empty.

**Always**: never put `[skip ci]` on a commit that shares a push with code
changes; after pushing a Greptile-fix round, verify a new CI run started on
the new head (`gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 2`) before re-triggering
Greptile.
