## CI `pull_request` run can silently not fire; empty commit re-triggers it (🟡 Minor)

On PR creation the first time, no CI run appeared at all (event never
delivered). An empty commit WITHOUT `[skip ci]` fired the `synchronize` event
and CI queued normally (the concurrency group auto-cancels the stale run).

**Always**: after opening a PR, check `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml` actually
shows a run; if missing, push an empty commit (message must NOT contain
`[skip ci]`) to re-fire the event.
